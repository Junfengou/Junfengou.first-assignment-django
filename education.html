        <br>I see that you're eagered to know whether I am educated or not...
            <br>
                well...I did graduate from Burke high school in 2015. I was a transfer student.
                <br> 
                Before Omaha, I was living in a small town called Dubuque, Iowa. 
                </br>   
                It's a small town right next to the Mississippi river. This town is so small, the Asian
                population is less than 1%! 
            </br>
        </p>

        <p>I started college right after graduating high school doing computer science related stuff</p>
        <p>Lately, I been devoting my time learning Javascript, Python and Linux. 
        <br>I find Python very interesting, and easier to understand than other languages</br>
