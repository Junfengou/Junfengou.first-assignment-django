    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I don't have alot free time because I work alot. 
        <br> During my free time, I like to watch standup comedies on Netflix, Youtube videos
        <br> and play video games. Occasionally when I'm really bored, I like to learn new 
        <br> coding languages. Recently, I been spending my time learning more about Javascript
        <br> and Python. I know little bit about Java from my previous class but I absolutely 
        <br> hated it. I do like cyber security related stuff, so maybe during the summer
        <br> I'll look more into it. </br>
