        <h1>Life before United States</h1>
        <p>I was born in China and came to the US when I was around 11 years old
            <br>My parents brought me here to get better education and a better life</br>
            I don't remember much about my life in China, so there's nothing interesting to tell
            <br> I came here around December 2007 and we kind of just moved around every few years. 
            <br> I was in St.Louis for few months...life was pretty good in the city. When we moved to 
            <br> the country side of Sevierville,Tennessee for roughly a year. After that, we moved to
            <br> Dubuque, Iowa for roughly 5 years and now I'm here.
